## Notes

#### All The Birds In The Sky

This story existed somewhere between sci-fi and fantasy, without being quite either. Maybe I'm just not a fan of vague ideas for vagueness sake, but it bothered me that important events in the books were never really explained. The main characters each belonged to a different community with different cultures and novelties to explore, yet as readers we didn't get to see much. That said, I felt some nostalgia following one of the characters' footsteps to MIT and then San Francisco. Descriptions of both these places evoked fond memories of my college time and reminded me that, as a relatively new resident of the Bay Area, there are still much for me to explore.

#### History, A Very Short Introduction

What a delightful read! I'd always been overwhelmed by history and this book, withs its promise of brevity, looked like a good overview. It did deliver on this, but not in the way I had expected. I finished the book with an understanding of the history of (Western) history, how fields of study emerged and evolved and became professionalized, and a deeper understanding of our collective quest for truth and understanding. On top of that, the author exuded an enviable ability to explain complex concepts with clarity. The prose was a pleasure to read. I'd recommend this book any day.
