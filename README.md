History, A Very Short Introduction

## Notes

#### History, A Very Short Introduction: 

What a delightful read! I'd always been overwhelmed by history and this book, withs its promise of brevity, looked like a good overview. It did deliver on this, but not in the way I had expected. I finished the book with an understanding of the history of (Western) history, how fields of study emerged and evolved and became professionalized, and a deeper understanding of our collective quest for truth and understanding. On top of that, the author exuded an enviable ability to explain complex concepts with clarity. The prose was a pleasure to read. I'd recommend this book any day.
